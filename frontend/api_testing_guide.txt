# Postman API Endpoint Testing Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to test the authentication API endpoints using an API client like Postman.

**Note:** The base URL for the API is assumed to be `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. Please replace this with your actual backend server address if it's different.

### 1. Request Phone Verification Code

This endpoint initiates the phone verification process by sending an SMS code to the provided mobile number.

- **Method:** `POST`
- **URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/request-phone-code/`
- **Headers:**
  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
- **Body (raw JSON):**
  ```json
  {
      "mobile_no": "+15551234567"
  }
  ```
- **Instructions:**
  1. Replace `+15551234567` with a valid mobile number in E.164 format.
  2. A successful response will contain a `session_id`. **Copy this `session_id`** as it is required for the next steps.

  }
  ```
- **Instructions:**
  1. Paste the `session_id` you received from the previous request.
  2. Replace `"123456"` with the actual verification code you received via SMS.

### 3. Register New User

      "mobile_no": "+15551234567",
      "verification_session_id": "PASTE_THE_SESSION_ID_FROM_STEP_1_HERE"
  }
  ```
- **Instructions:**
  1. Fill in the user details (`email`, `password`, `first_name`, `last_name`).
